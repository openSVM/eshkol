# Eshkol: Purpose and Vision

## Mission Statement

Eshkol is a high-performance programming language designed to bridge the gap between symbolic and numeric computing, enabling the development of next-generation neuro-symbolic AI systems and scientific applications with uncompromising performance, expressiveness, and safety.

## Vision

Eshkol aims to become the language of choice for researchers and engineers working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and systems programming. By combining the elegance and expressiveness of Scheme with the performance of C and modern language features, Eshkol will enable new approaches to AI that seamlessly integrate symbolic reasoning with neural computation.

In the long term, we envision Eshkol powering:

- **Self-modifying AI systems** that can reason about and improve their own algorithms
- **Neuro-symbolic models** that combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning
- **High-performance scientific simulations** that require both computational efficiency and mathematical expressiveness
- **Embedded AI applications** where performance and memory constraints are critical

## Core Principles

Eshkol is guided by the following core principles:

### 1. Homoiconicity with Performance

Eshkol preserves the homoiconicity of Lisp/Scheme (code as data) while delivering C-level performance. This enables powerful metaprogramming and self-modifying code without sacrificing execution speed.

### 2. Gradual Typing

Eshkol embraces optional static typing, allowing developers to start with dynamic typing for rapid prototyping and gradually add type annotations for performance and safety as code matures.

### 3. Scientific Computing as a First-Class Citizen

Unlike languages that rely on external libraries for scientific computing, Eshkol integrates vector operations, automatic differentiation, and SIMD optimization directly into the language core.

### 4. Memory Efficiency

Eshkol's arena-based memory management system provides deterministic performance without the unpredictable pauses of garbage collection, making it suitable for real-time applications.

### 5. Seamless C Interoperability

Eshkol compiles directly to C, enabling seamless integration with the vast ecosystem of C libraries and tools without performance penalties.

### 6. Scheme Compatibility

Eshkol maintains compatibility with standard Scheme (R5RS and R7RS), allowing developers to leverage existing Scheme code and knowledge.

## Target Domains

Eshkol is particularly well-suited for the following domains:

### Artificial Intelligence

- **Neuro-symbolic AI**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning
- **Self-modifying AI**: Systems that can modify their own code
- **Differentiable programming**: End-to-end differentiable algorithms
- **Embedded AI**: AI systems with strict performance and memory constraints

### Scientific Computing

- **Numerical simulations**: Physics, chemistry, biology, etc.
- **Data analysis**: Statistical modeling and analysis
- **Signal processing**: Audio, image, and video processing
- **Optimization**: Constraint solving and optimization problems

### Systems Programming

- **High-performance computing**: Parallel and distributed systems
- **Embedded systems**: Resource-constrained environments
- **Real-time systems**: Applications with strict timing requirements

## Historical Context

Eshkol builds on the rich tradition of Lisp and Scheme, languages that have been at the forefront of AI research since its inception. By combining this symbolic heritage with modern performance-oriented features, Eshkol aims to revitalize the Lisp tradition for the era of deep learning and high-performance computing.

The name "Eshkol" honors the concept of structured notation and systematic thinking, reflecting the language's goal of bringing structure and clarity to complex computational problems.

## The Path Forward

Eshkol is being developed with a phased approach:

1. **Core Language Implementation**: Establishing the fundamental language features and Scheme compatibility
2. **Scientific Computing Extensions**: Building out the scientific computing capabilities
3. **AI-Specific Features**: Enhancing support for neuro-symbolic AI development
4. **Ecosystem Development**: Building libraries, tools, and community resources

We invite researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to join us in developing Eshkol into a powerful tool for the future of AI and scientific computing.
