# Eshkol Planning Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the planning and design of the Eshkol programming language.

## Documents

### [Initial Design Conversation](initial_design_conversation.md)
The initial design discussion for Eshkol, covering the core concepts, goals, and design decisions.

## Planning Process

The development of Eshkol follows a structured planning process:

1. **Conceptualization**: Defining the core concepts and goals of the language
2. **Design**: Detailed design of language features and implementation strategies
3. **Implementation**: Phased implementation of the language
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all language features
5. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of the language
6. **Release**: Release of the language to the community

## Design Principles

Eshkol's design is guided by several key principles:

- **Performance**: Eshkol aims to provide C-level performance for scientific computing and AI workloads
- **Expressiveness**: Eshkol aims to provide a high level of expressiveness for complex algorithms
- **Safety**: Eshkol aims to provide safety features that catch errors at compile time when possible
- **Interoperability**: Eshkol aims to provide seamless interoperability with existing C code
- **Compatibility**: Eshkol aims to be compatible with existing Scheme code

## Future Planning

Future planning documents will be added to this directory as the language evolves, including:

- Detailed design documents for specific language features
- Implementation plans for future phases
- Roadmaps for ecosystem development
- Community governance plans
