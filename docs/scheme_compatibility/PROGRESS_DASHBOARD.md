## Implementation Roadmaps

The following roadmaps provide detailed plans for implementing specific features:

1. [Type Predicates Roadmap](./roadmaps/type_predicates_roadmap.md)
2. [Equality Predicates Roadmap](./roadmaps/equality_predicates_roadmap.md)
3. [List Processing Roadmap](./roadmaps/list_processing_roadmap.md)
4. [Higher-Order Functions Roadmap](./roadmaps/higher_order_functions_roadmap.md)

## Example Files

The following example files demonstrate the use of Scheme features in Eshkol:

1. [Type Predicates](../../examples/type_predicates.esk)
2. [Equality Predicates](../../examples/equality_predicates.esk)
3. [List Operations](../../examples/list_operations.esk)
4. [Function Composition](../../examples/function_composition.esk)
5. [Mutual Recursion](../../examples/mutual_recursion.esk)

## Known Issues

See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for a detailed list of known issues and limitations.

## Next Steps

   - Implement additional list processing functions
   - Implement basic higher-order functions (map, for-each)

2. **Q3 2025**:
   - Implement advanced higher-order functions (filter, fold-left, fold-right)
   - Improve type system integration with Scheme
   - Fix mutual recursion handling in type inference
   - Improve autodiff integration with Scheme

3. **Q4 2025**:

   - Begin work on the full numeric tower
   - Begin work on the hygienic macro system

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to Scheme compatibility in Eshkol, here are some ways to get involved:

1. **Implement Missing Features**: Pick a feature from the roadmaps and implement it.
2. **Fix Known Issues**: Choose an issue from the [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md) file and fix it.
3. **Improve Documentation**: Update or expand the documentation for Scheme features.
4. **Create Example Files**: Create example files that demonstrate the use of Scheme features.
5. **Improve MCP Tools**: Enhance the MCP tools for Scheme compatibility analysis.
