# Eshkol Development Documentation

This directory will contain documentation related to the development of the Eshkol programming language.

## Coming Soon

Detailed development documentation is currently under development and will be added in the future. This will include:

- **Development Environment Setup**: How to set up a development environment for Eshkol
- **Build Process**: How to build Eshkol from source
- **Testing**: How to run tests and add new tests
- **Contributing**: How to contribute to Eshkol
- **Coding Standards**: Coding standards for Eshkol development
- **Release Process**: How to create a release of Eshkol

## Current Development Process

Eshkol is being developed using a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Core Language Implementation (2025)
2. **Phase 2**: Scientific Computing Extensions (2025-2026)
3. **Phase 3**: AI-Specific Features (2026-2027)
4. **Phase 4**: Ecosystem Development (2027-2028)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Features and Optimizations (2028+)

For more information on Eshkol's development roadmap, see the [Future Roadmap](../vision/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md).

## Building Eshkol

To build Eshkol from source:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
cd build
make test
```

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions from researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts who share our vision for Eshkol. See the [Future Roadmap](../vision/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md) document for information on how to get involved.
