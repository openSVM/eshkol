# Recent Updates to Scheme Compatibility Documentation

Last Updated: 2025-03-29

This document summarizes the recent updates to the Scheme compatibility documentation for the Eshkol project.

## New Example Files

- [Type Predicates](../../examples/type_predicates.esk): Demonstrates the use of type predicates in Eshkol
- [Equality Predicates](../../examples/equality_predicates.esk): Demonstrates the use of equality predicates
- [Higher-Order Functions](../../examples/higher_order_functions.esk): Demonstrates the implementation and use of higher-order functions

## New Documentation

- [Progress Dashboard](PROGRESS_DASHBOARD.md): High-level overview of Scheme compatibility progress
- [Cheat Sheet](CHEAT_SHEET.md): Quick reference for Scheme compatibility features
- [Higher-Order Functions Roadmap](roadmaps/higher_order_functions_roadmap.md): Implementation plan for higher-order functions

## Updated Documentation

- [Known Issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md): Updated with new issues and limitations
- [README.md](README.md): Updated with links to new documentation

## Next Steps

For the next session, consider:

1. Implementing some of the planned features in the roadmaps
2. Creating more example files for other Scheme features
3. Updating the MASTER_TRACKING.md file with the latest progress
4. Creating implementation templates for equality predicates and higher-order functions

## Summary of Progress

We've made significant progress in documenting the Scheme compatibility features of Eshkol, including:

- Creating comprehensive example files that demonstrate how to use various Scheme features
- Developing detailed roadmaps for implementing missing features
- Creating a progress dashboard and cheat sheet for quick reference
- Updating existing documentation to reflect the current state of the project

These updates provide a solid foundation for the next phase of Scheme compatibility implementation, focusing on type predicates, equality predicates, and higher-order functions.
