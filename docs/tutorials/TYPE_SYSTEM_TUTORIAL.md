## Introduction

Eshkol's type system is designed to enhance code safety, performance, and expressiveness while maintaining full compatibility with standard Scheme. This tutorial will guide you through using the type system effectively in your Eshkol programs.

The type system offers three main approaches to typing:
- Implicit typing through type inference
- Inline explicit typing with parameter annotations
- Separate type declarations

This tutorial will cover all three approaches, starting with the simplest and progressing to more advanced features.
