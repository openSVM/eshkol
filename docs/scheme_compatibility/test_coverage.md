## Test Files
- `tests/unit/test_pairs.c`: Tests for pair and list operations (Planned)
- `tests/unit/test_predicates.c`: Tests for type predicates (Planned)
- `tests/unit/test_equality.c`: Tests for equality predicates (Planned)
- `tests/unit/test_arithmetic.c`: Tests for arithmetic operations (Planned)
- `tests/integration/test_scheme_compatibility.c`: Integration tests for Scheme compatibility (Planned)

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
Unit tests verify the correct behavior of individual functions with normal inputs. Each function should have unit tests that cover:

- Basic functionality with typical inputs
- Different types of arguments (where applicable)
- Different numbers of arguments (for variadic functions)
- Return value correctness

### Edge Case Tests
Edge case tests verify the correct behavior of functions with boundary conditions. Each function should have edge case tests that cover:

- Empty inputs (empty lists, strings, etc.)
- Minimum and maximum values
- Zero values
- Negative values (where applicable)
- Special cases mentioned in the Scheme standard

### Error Tests
Error tests verify appropriate error handling. Each function should have error tests that cover:

- Wrong number of arguments
- Wrong type of arguments
- Invalid inputs
- Resource exhaustion (memory, stack, etc.)

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify the correct interaction between functions. Integration tests should cover:

- Common function combinations
- Complex expressions
- Examples from the Scheme standard
- Real-world Scheme code

## Known Test Gaps
- No tests for circular lists
- No tests for very large lists
- No tests for memory exhaustion
- No tests for stack overflow

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Phase 1**: 100% unit test coverage, 90% edge case coverage, 80% integration coverage
- **Phase 2**: 100% unit test coverage, 90% edge case coverage, 80% integration coverage
- **Phase 3**: 100% unit test coverage, 90% edge case coverage, 80% integration coverage
- **Phase 4**: 100% unit test coverage, 90% edge case coverage, 80% integration coverage
- **Phase 5**: 100% unit test coverage, 90% edge case coverage, 80% integration coverage

## Test Automation
- Unit tests and edge case tests are run automatically on every build
- Integration tests are run automatically on every release
- Test coverage is measured using gcov
- Test results are reported in the build log
