# Eshkol Architecture Documentation

This directory will contain documentation related to the architecture of the Eshkol programming language.

## Coming Soon

Detailed architecture documentation is currently under development and will be added in the future. This will include:

- **Compiler Architecture**: Overview of the Eshkol compiler's architecture
- **Runtime Architecture**: Overview of the Eshkol runtime system
- **Memory Management**: Details of Eshkol's arena-based memory management system
- **Type System**: Details of Eshkol's gradual typing system
- **Execution Model**: Details of how Eshkol code is executed

## Current Architecture

Eshkol's architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: Lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis
2. **Type System**: Gradual typing with inference
3. **Optimizer**: High-level optimizations
4. **Backend**: Code generation to C
5. **Runtime**: Memory management, error handling, and standard library

For more information on Eshkol's architecture, see the [Technical White Paper](../vision/TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER.md).
