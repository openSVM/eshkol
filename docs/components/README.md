# Eshkol Components Documentation

This directory will contain documentation related to the components of the Eshkol programming language.

## Coming Soon

Detailed component documentation is currently under development and will be added in the future. This will include:

- **Lexer**: Details of the lexical analyzer
- **Parser**: Details of the parser
- **Type Checker**: Details of the type checker
- **Optimizer**: Details of the optimizer
- **Code Generator**: Details of the code generator
- **Runtime Library**: Details of the runtime library
- **Standard Library**: Details of the standard library

## Current Components

Eshkol consists of several key components:

### Frontend

- **Lexer**: Converts source code into tokens
- **Parser**: Converts tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- **Type Checker**: Performs type checking and inference

### Middle-end

- **Optimizer**: Performs high-level optimizations on the AST

### Backend

- **Code Generator**: Converts the AST to C code
- **C Compiler**: Compiles the generated C code to machine code

### Runtime

- **Memory Manager**: Manages memory allocation and deallocation
- **Error Handler**: Handles runtime errors
- **Standard Library**: Provides standard functions and data structures

For more information on Eshkol's components, see the [Technical White Paper](../vision/TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER.md).
