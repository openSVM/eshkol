## Current Focus
The current focus is on two parallel tracks:

1. **Core Scheme Compatibility**: Building on the implemented core list operations (cons, car, cdr), adding basic type predicates and additional list processing functions, which form the foundation of Scheme's data model.

2. **Type System and Scientific Computing**: Improving type inference for autodiff and vector operations to ensure proper type checking and code generation for scientific computing features.

## Implementation Strategy
We are following a phased approach to Scheme compatibility, starting with the most fundamental features and progressively adding more advanced functionality. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for future development.

### Phase 1: Core Data Types and Fundamental Operations
- Core list operations (cons, car, cdr)
- Basic type predicates (pair?, null?, list?, etc.)
- Numeric operations (partially implemented)
- Boolean operations (partially implemented)
- Character operations
- String operations

### Phase 2: List Processing and Control Flow
- List manipulation functions (append, list-ref, etc.)
- Control flow constructs (partially implemented)
- Iteration constructs (partially implemented)
- Conditional constructs (partially implemented)

### Phase 3: Higher-Order Functions and Data Structures
- Map, filter, fold
- Association lists
- Vectors (partially implemented)
- Records

### Phase 4: I/O and System Interface
- File I/O
- String ports
- System interface

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Continuations
- Hygienic macros
- Full numeric tower
- Advanced I/O features
- Module system

## MCP Tools Integration
We have developed several MCP tools to assist with Scheme compatibility implementation:

- **analyze-scheme-recursion**: Analyzes mutual recursion and lambda captures in Scheme code
- **analyze-tscheme-recursion**: Uses improved TScheme parser for recursion analysis
- **analyze-bindings**: Analyzes variable bindings in Scheme code
- **analyze-lambda-captures**: Analyzes closure environments and variable captures

These tools help identify potential issues with Scheme compatibility and provide insights into how Scheme code is structured and executed.

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 months)
- Implement additional list processing functions
- Add basic type predicates
- Enhance MCP tools for better Scheme code analysis

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Complete Phase 1 (Core Data Types and Fundamental Operations)
- Begin Phase 2 (List Processing and Control Flow)
- Improve integration with the type system

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- Complete Phase 2
- Begin Phase 3 (Higher-Order Functions and Data Structures)
- Enhance compatibility with R5RS and R7RS-small standards

## How to Use This Documentation
- **For implementers**: Start with the [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) and [Registry](./REGISTRY.md) to understand what needs to be implemented and in what order.
- **For users**: Check the [Function Status](./function_status/) directory to see which Scheme functions are currently supported.
- **For contributors**: Review the [Templates](./templates/) directory for guidelines on implementing new functions.

## Contribution Guidelines
When contributing to Scheme compatibility in Eshkol:
1. Check the registry to ensure the function isn't already implemented
2. Review the standard specification carefully
3. Understand dependencies and ensure they're implemented first
4. Follow the function signature exactly as specified in the standard
5. Include comprehensive tests covering all cases in the standard
6. Document any deviations from the standard
7. Update the registry with implementation details
8. Use MCP tools to analyze your implementation for potential issues
