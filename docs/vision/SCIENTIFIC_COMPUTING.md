# Eshkol: Scientific Computing Advantages

This document details how Eshkol provides unique advantages for scientific computing applications, from numerical simulations to data analysis.

## The Scientific Computing Challenge

Scientific computing faces several key challenges:

1. **Performance vs. Expressiveness**: Scientists often must choose between high-level languages that are easy to use but slow (Python, R, MATLAB) and low-level languages that are fast but difficult to use (C, C++, Fortran).

2. **Correctness and Reproducibility**: Scientific code must produce correct and reproducible results, which requires careful attention to numerical precision, determinism, and validation.

3. **Scalability**: Scientific applications often need to scale from laptops to supercomputers, requiring efficient parallelization and memory management.

4. **Interoperability**: Scientific code often needs to interface with existing libraries, data formats, and tools.

Eshkol addresses these challenges by providing a unique combination of features that make it particularly well-suited for scientific computing.

## Built-in Vector and Matrix Operations

### First-Class Vector Types

Eshkol treats vectors and matrices as first-class types in the language, with built-in operations that are both concise and efficient:

```scheme
;; Vector creation and operations
(define v1 #[1.0 2.0 3.0])
(define v2 #[4.0 5.0 6.0])
(define v3 (+ v1 v2))  ; => #[5.0 7.0 9.0]
(define dot-product (dot v1 v2))  ; => 32.0
(define magnitude (norm v1))  ; => 3.7416573867739413

;; Matrix creation and operations
(define m1 #[#[1.0 2.0] #[3.0 4.0]])
(define m2 #[#[5.0 6.0] #[7.0 8.0]])
(define m3 (+ m1 m2))  ; => #[#[6.0 8.0] #[10.0 12.0]]
(define m4 (matmul m1 m2))  ; => #[#[19.0 22.0] #[43.0 50.0]]
```

### SIMD Optimization

Eshkol automatically applies SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations to vector and matrix operations, providing near-optimal performance without requiring manual vectorization:

```scheme
;; This code automatically uses SIMD instructions
(define (vector-add v1 v2)
  (+ v1 v2))

;; Equivalent to manually vectorized code in C:
;; for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
;;   __m128 a = _mm_load_ps(&v1[i]);
;;   __m128 b = _mm_load_ps(&v2[i]);
;;   __m128 c = _mm_add_ps(a, b);
;;   _mm_store_ps(&result[i], c);
;; }
```

### Numerical Stability

Eshkol provides built-in functions for numerically stable computations:

```scheme
;; Numerically stable sum
(define (stable-sum xs)
  (compensated-sum xs))

;; Numerically stable linear algebra
(define (solve-linear-system A b)
  (svd-solve A b))
```

## Automatic Differentiation for Scientific Computing

### Physical Simulations

Eshkol's built-in automatic differentiation enables efficient implementation of physical simulations:

```scheme
;; Define a physical system
(define (pendulum-energy theta omega length mass gravity)
  (+ (* 0.5 mass (square length) (square omega))  ; Kinetic energy
     (* mass gravity length (- 1.0 (cos theta))))) ; Potential energy

;; Compute forces (derivatives of energy)
(define force-theta (derivative pendulum-energy 0))
(define force-omega (derivative pendulum-energy 1))

;; Simulate the system
(define (simulate initial-state time-step num-steps)
  (iterate-system initial-state time-step num-steps force-theta force-omega))
```

### Optimization Problems

Automatic differentiation simplifies the implementation of optimization algorithms:

```scheme
;; Define an objective function
(define (rosenbrock x y)
  (+ (square (- 1.0 x))
     (* 100.0 (square (- y (square x))))))

;; Compute gradients
(define grad-x (derivative rosenbrock 0))
(define grad-y (derivative rosenbrock 1))

;; Gradient descent optimization
(define (optimize-rosenbrock initial-x initial-y learning-rate num-steps)
  (gradient-descent initial-x initial-y learning-rate num-steps
                   grad-x grad-y))
```

### Partial Differential Equations

Eshkol's automatic differentiation can be used to solve partial differential equations:

```scheme
;; Define a PDE (heat equation)
(define (heat-equation u x t diffusivity)
  (- (derivative u 1)  ; du/dt
     (* diffusivity (derivative (derivative u 0) 0))))  ; d^2u/dx^2

;; Solve using finite differences with automatic derivatives
(define (solve-heat-equation initial-condition boundary-conditions
                            diffusivity time-steps space-steps)
  (finite-difference-solver heat-equation
                           initial-condition boundary-conditions
                           diffusivity time-steps space-steps))
```

## Parallelism for Scientific Computing

### Multi-Core Parallelism

Eshkol provides built-in primitives for parallel computation on multi-core systems:

```scheme
;; Parallel map for data processing
(define (process-dataset dataset)
  (pmap process-item dataset))

;; Parallel fold for reduction
(define (compute-statistics dataset)
  (pfold combine-statistics empty-statistics
        (pmap compute-item-statistics dataset)))
```

### GPGPU Computing

Eshkol can leverage GPUs for scientific computing through its C interoperability:

```scheme
;; Define a GPU kernel
(define-gpu-kernel matrix-multiply
  :args ((array float) (array float) (array float) int int int)
  :grid-dim [16 16]
  :block-dim [16 16]
  :body "
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (row < n && col < p) {
      float sum = 0.0f;
      for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        sum += a[row * m + i] * b[i * p + col];
      }
      c[row * p + col] = sum;
    }
  ")

;; Use the GPU kernel
(define (gpu-matmul a b)
  (let* ([n (rows a)]
         [m (cols a)]
         [p (cols b)]
         [c (make-matrix n p)])
    (matrix-multiply a b c n m p)
    c))
```

### Distributed Computing

Eshkol supports distributed computing for large-scale scientific applications:

```scheme
;; Define a distributed computation
(define-distributed-computation monte-carlo-pi
  :workers 100
  :samples-per-worker 1000000
  :worker-function (lambda (worker-id num-samples)
                     (count-points-in-circle num-samples))
  :reduce-function (lambda (results)
                     (/ (* 4.0 (sum results))
                        (* 100 1000000))))
```

## Memory Efficiency for Scientific Computing

### Arena-Based Allocation

Eshkol's arena-based memory management is particularly well-suited for scientific computing:

```scheme
;; Create a memory arena for a simulation
(define simulation-arena (make-arena 1024 1024 1024))  ; 1GB arena

;; Allocate vectors and matrices in the arena
(with-arena simulation-arena
  (let* ([state-vector (make-vector 1000000)]
         [jacobian (make-matrix 1000000 10)])
    (run-simulation state-vector jacobian)))

;; Arena is automatically cleared after the computation
```

### Memory Locality

Eshkol provides tools for optimizing memory locality in scientific computations:

```scheme
;; Define a blocked matrix multiplication for better cache utilization
(define (blocked-matmul a b block-size)
  (let* ([n (rows a)]
         [m (cols a)]
         [p (cols b)]
         [c (make-matrix n p)])
    (for-each-block [i-block (ceiling-divide n block-size)]
                   [j-block (ceiling-divide p block-size)]
      (for-each-block [k-block (ceiling-divide m block-size)]
        (multiply-blocks a b c
                        (* i-block block-size)
                        (* k-block block-size)
                        (* k-block block-size)
                        (* j-block block-size)
                        block-size)))
    c))
```

(define velocity (/ distance time))  ; => 5.0[m/s]

;; Unit checking prevents errors
(define mass 1.0[kg])
(define force (* mass (/ distance (* time time))))  ; => 2.5[N]
(define energy (* force distance))  ; => 25.0[J]

;; Automatic unit conversion
(define energy-in-eV (convert energy 'eV))  ; => 1.56e20[eV]
```

### Mathematical Notation
