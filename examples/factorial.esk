;; Factorial function in Eshkol
;; This is a simple example demonstrating recursion and conditional expressions

;; Define the factorial function
(define (factorial n)
  (if (< n 2)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; Main function
(define (main)
  (printf "Factorial of 5 is %d\n" (factorial 5))
  (printf "Factorial of 10 is %d\n" (factorial 10))
  0)  ; Return 0 to indicate success
