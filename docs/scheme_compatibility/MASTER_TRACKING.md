## Phase Status Summary
| Phase | Description | Status | Progress |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Core Data Types and Fundamental Operations | Planning | 0% |
| 2 | List Processing and Control Flow | Not Started | 0% |
| 3 | Higher-Order Functions and Data Structures | Not Started | 0% |
| 4 | Type System | In Progress | 50% |
| 5 | I/O and System Interface | Not Started | 0% |
| 6 | Scientific Computing and AI Features | Partially Implemented | 40% |
| 7 | Advanced Features | Not Started | 0% |

## Current Focus
The current focus is on two parallel tracks:

1. **Core Scheme Compatibility**: Implementing the core list operations (cons, car, cdr) and basic type predicates, which form the foundation of Scheme's data model.

2. **Type System and Scientific Computing**: Improving type inference for autodiff and vector operations to ensure proper type checking and code generation for scientific computing features.

## Implementation Strategy
We are following a phased approach to Scheme compatibility, starting with the most fundamental features and progressively adding more advanced functionality. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for future development.

## How to Use This Documentation
- **For implementers**: Start with the [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) and [Registry](./REGISTRY.md) to understand what needs to be implemented and in what order.
- **For users**: Check the [Function Status](./function_status/) directory to see which Scheme functions are currently supported.
- **For contributors**: Review the [Templates](./templates/) directory for guidelines on implementing new functions.

## Contribution Guidelines
When contributing to Scheme compatibility in Eshkol:
1. Check the registry to ensure the function isn't already implemented
2. Review the standard specification carefully
3. Understand dependencies and ensure they're implemented first
4. Follow the function signature exactly as specified in the standard
5. Include comprehensive tests covering all cases in the standard
6. Document any deviations from the standard
7. Update the registry with implementation details
