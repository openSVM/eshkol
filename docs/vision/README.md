## Key Features

- **Homoiconicity with Performance**: Eshkol preserves the homoiconicity of Lisp/Scheme (code as data) while delivering C-level performance.
- **Gradual Typing**: Eshkol embraces optional static typing, allowing developers to start with dynamic typing for rapid prototyping and gradually add type annotations for performance and safety.
- **Scientific Computing as a First-Class Citizen**: Eshkol integrates vector operations, automatic differentiation, and SIMD optimization directly into the language core.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Eshkol's arena-based memory management system provides deterministic performance without the unpredictable pauses of garbage collection.
- **Seamless C Interoperability**: Eshkol compiles directly to C, enabling seamless integration with the vast ecosystem of C libraries and tools.
- **Scheme Compatibility**: Eshkol maintains compatibility with standard Scheme (R5RS and R7RS), allowing developers to leverage existing Scheme code and knowledge.
